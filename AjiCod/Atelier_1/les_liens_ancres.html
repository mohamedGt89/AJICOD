        <h2 id="cuisine">la cuisine</h2>
        <p>La cuisine est l'ensemble des techniques de préparation des aliments en vue de leur consommation par les êtres humains que l'on a appelé précédemment « la cuisinerie ». La cuisine est diverse à travers le monde. Elle est l'un des éléments représentant la notion de terroir quand elle est le fruit des ressources naturelles et productions agricoles locales, des us et coutumes, de la culture et des croyances, du perfectionnement des techniques, des échanges entre peuples et cultures.Each people , nation or civilization has developed, from local natural resources but also from the character of each society, social evolution, traditions , interactions, different cuisines. The movements of peoples throughout history have caused mixtures and evolutions in cuisine. For example, European cuisine was enriched by the contributions of the Crusaders returning from the Crusades and upset by the products brought back from America in the 15th and 16th centuries ,  which entered the European tradition (tomato , turkey, potato, etc.).

            In the 17th  century , great French cuisine was developed, which became an “art” and spread throughout what was then called the civilized world. With the near-global European colonization at the end of the 19th century  , the standard of European cuisine seemed to take hold. In the 1970s, the new cuisine developed , which gave way ten years later to, "on the one hand, the competition between increasingly numerous national haute cuisines and, on the other, the clash of technical-conceptual cuisine with the so-called “supernatural” cuisine 1. This gives rise, each time, to beautiful confrontations between neophiles and neophobes  ” 2 .
            
            At the end of the 20th  century, cuisines were mixed from contributions from all over the world ( world food  (en) ), while the great non-European cuisines in turn penetrated Western countries ( Algerian cuisine , Moroccan cuisine , Caribbean cuisine , Mexican cuisine , Chinese cuisine , Indian cuisine , Japanese cuisine , etc.). Globalization thus leads to transnational cuisines with the internalization of  mass food consumption 3.
            
            From texts preserved or copied since Antiquity, from objects found during archaeological excavations and, more recently thanks to carpology , we can learn about the cuisine of the peoples of Prehistory , Protohistory , Antiquity —notably in Ancient Egypt , Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome  —and from Europeans in the Middle Ages .

            Reconstructions of food recipes as they existed at the time are part of what was called, in the 20th century  , “historical cuisine”.

            La cuisine a ainsi dépassé son simple impératif biologique d'alimentation pour devenir un corpus de techniques plus ou moins pointues, un fait culturel, un élément de patrimoine et d'identité national ou familial, un élément de systèmes de valeurs, mais aussi un sujet d'étude pour les sciences sociales et la sociologie, voire un enjeu de politique et de santé publique.</p>

            In the 17th  century , great French cuisine was developed, which became an “art” and spread throughout what was then called the civilized world. With the near-global European colonization at the end of the 19th century  , the standard of European cuisine seemed to take hold. In the 1970s, the new cuisine developed , which gave way ten years later to, "on the one hand, the competition between increasingly numerous national haute cuisines and, on the other, the clash of technical-conceptual cuisine with the so-called “supernatural” cuisine 1. This gives rise, each time, to beautiful confrontations between neophiles and neophobes  ” 2 .
            
            At the end of the 20th  century, cuisines were mixed from contributions from all over the world ( world food  (en) ), while the great non-European cuisines in turn penetrated Western countries ( Algerian cuisine , Moroccan cuisine , Caribbean cuisine , Mexican cuisine , Chinese cuisine , Indian cuisine , Japanese cuisine , etc.).

The Israeli occupation of the Palestinians. It continued to be organized by the Palestinian Unified National Command and the Palestine Liberation Organization later. The Intifada began onDecember 9 , 1987 and subsided in 1991 , and finally stopped with the signing of the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 . . The term intifada was used for the first time to describe the Palestinian popular revolution in the first statement issued by the Hamas movement that was distributed in Gaza on December 11, 1987.

The statement said: "The uprising of our people who are stationed in the occupied land came in rejection of all the occupation and its pressures, and to awaken the consciences of those eager for the meager peace, behind the empty international conferences." The term entered the field of the Arab and Western press, which transmitted it in its Arabic language, as it was used by analysts and authors, even within the Israeli community, where the journalists Ze'ev Schiff and Ehud Yaari wroteA book about this historical period and called it "Intifada". It is estimated that 1,300 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli army during the events of the first intifada, and 160 Israelis were killed by Palestinians. In addition, it is estimated that 1,000 Palestinians allegedly collaborating with the Israeli authorities were killed by Palestinians, although this is proven by only less than half of them. The first intifada achieved unprecedented political results, as the existence of the Palestinian people was recognized through the Israeli-American recognition of the residents of the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip as being part of the Palestinian people and not Jordanians. Israel realized that the occupation has a negative impact on Palestinian society, and the military leadership announced that there is no military solution to the conflict with the Palestinians, which means the need to search for a political solution despite Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 's refusal to discuss any political settlement with the Palestinian</p>

            In the 17th  century , great French cuisine was developed, which became an “art” and spread throughout what was then called the civilized world. With the near-global European colonization at the end of the 19th century  , the standard of European cuisine seemed to take hold. In the 1970s, the new cuisine developed , which gave way ten years later to, "on the one hand, the competition between increasingly numerous national haute cuisines and, on the other, the clash of technical-conceptual cuisine with the so-called “supernatural” cuisine 1. This gives rise, each time, to beautiful confrontations between neophiles and neophobes  ” 2 .
            
            At the end of the 20th  century, cuisines were mixed from contributions from all over the world ( world food  (en) ), while the great non-European cuisines in turn penetrated Western countries ( Algerian cuisine , Moroccan cuisine , Caribbean cuisine , Mexican cuisine , Chinese cuisine , Indian cuisine , Japanese cuisine , etc.). Globalization thus leads to transnational cuisines with the internalization of  mass food consumption 3.
            
            From texts preserved or copied since Antiquity, from objects found during archaeological excavations and, more recently thanks to carpology , we can learn about the cuisine of the peoples of Prehistory , Protohistory , Antiquity —notably in Ancient Egypt , Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome  —and from Europeans in the Middle Ages .
